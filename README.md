# grapesjs-plugin-formfields
> grapesjs plugin to build form aka GrapesJs FormBuilder plugin

The primary goal of this plugin is to allow for building of Generic form field components that provide the same trait/behavior on the GrapeJS editor but render different output for different CSS frameworks.  The base design is similar to the GrapesJs MJML plugin.  The initial CSS framework is bootstrap4.

# Planning
